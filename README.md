## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This challenge helped me better understand how to read design files and use them to help me ensure that the sites I develop are pixel perfect. Even as someone who has used Figma to design, I didn't realize until working on this design just how much information you can obtain from the Figma file.


### Continued development

I will continue improving my ability to read design files and use them as a guide to develop websites exactly as they were designed to be.
